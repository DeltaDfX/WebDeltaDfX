        <h6>What is Lorem Ipsum?
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
          the
          industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
          type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
          leap
          into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
          with the
          release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing
          software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

          Why do we use it?
          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
          when
          looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
          distribution
          of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
          English. Many
          desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
          text, and a
          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
          have
          evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
          like).


          Where does it come from?
          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
          classical
          Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
          professor at
          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
          from a
          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
          the
          undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
          et
          Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
          the
          theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
          ipsum dolor
          sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

          The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
          Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
          in their
          exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
          Rackham.</h6>
